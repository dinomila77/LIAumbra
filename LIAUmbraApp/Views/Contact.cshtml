	@*Html.Action: Renders the partial view as an HtmlString .This method result can be stored in a variable, since it returns string type value.
	
	Html.RenderAction: This method result will be directly written to the HTTP response stream means it used the same TextWriter object as used
	in the current webpage/template. This method is faster than Action method since its result is directly written to the 
	HTTP response stream which makes it fast.*@
